## Install and Run Instructions
  The user must have Python 3.5.3. and above in order to install Pandas. Furthermore, Pandas is dependent on other libraries many times - like NumPy and Matplotlib. Hence, the easiest way to get Pandas is through a package like Anaconda Distribution. This distribution platform is very useful for data analysis and scientific computing. You can install Anaconda Distribution for Windows, MacOS, or Linux via this link: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual . In order to create an Anaconda environment after installing, you must open your Terminal prompt and run the following code: conda create -n myenv python=3.9 pandas jupyter seaborn scikit-learn keras tensorflow to create an environment named myenv. 
  After installing the Anaconda Distribution, make sure your Visual Studio Code has the following extensions: Python Extension for VS Code and Jupyter Extension for VS Code. You will then open Visual Studio Code and create a Jupyter notebook. After doing so, click "Select Kernal" at the top right of the screen. Select the Python environment created previously equipped with Anaconda Distribution. 
  The last step is to import the libraries we will need in order to efficiently use Pandas & additional libraries for extra support. First, open Terminal and use the "-pip install" functions to bring in pandas and numpy. Then, following code is used to import Pandas within our program: "import pandas as pd". 
  Now you are all set to use Pandas within Jupyter Notebook in order to develop your code!
