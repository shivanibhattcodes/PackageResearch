# Pandas: Python Data Analysis Library
## Package Summary 
  Pandas is a game changer when it comes to data analysis using Python. It is open source and free to use under a BSD License. THe original code is credited to Wes McKinney. High level use of Pandas includes taking data (usually via a CSV file or SQL database) and creating a python object that has capabilities similar to that of Microsoft Excel. 

## Install and Run Instructions
  The user must have Python 3.5.3. and above in order to install Pandas. Furthermore, Pandas is dependent on other libraries many times - like NumPy and Matplotlib. Hence, the easiest way to get Pandas is through a package like Anaconda Distribution. This distribution platform is very useful for data analysis and scientific computing. You can install Anaconda Distribution for Windows, MacOS, or Linux via this link: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual . After installing this, use the following code in order to import both pandas and numpy into your Python IDE: 
           **     import pandas as pd 
                import numpy as np**
